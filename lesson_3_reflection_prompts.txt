When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

- When you are going to be working on more than one machine.
- To provide an offsite backup for your project
- When you are going to collaborate with other developers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Changes made on the local master branch could cause errors or conflicts
  with the origin/master branch
